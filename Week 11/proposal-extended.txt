A task manager program that assists with timeblocking and managing the priority of my tickets at work.
It will assist me with creating good closing notes for the end user and work notes for both me and my team.

Our serviceNow instance only has a few priority levels - I want to make more... It will help me organize my work better.

I want to add color to the items based on there importance and there location. Items that need completed ASAP will be red in my queue.
I want to be able to sort my tickets by location (building and floor)

Allow for me to break a ticket into a subtask so that it's easier to digest. There might be bits and peices that I can't do all at once. (need to wait on people)

I'd like to make some sort of text box that I can add notes to with differert "categories" that allow for me to click on differnet things to put in for the work notes.
(values will be saved to a file.)

have a field that asks for how long it's going to take so that it can be timeblocked on my calender
end user might have a preferred time, that needs to be added to.

Keep hold of a link to the ticket so that I can easily navigate to it from the tool.

Tasks will be store in KV pairs. The "V" will be a list of task items. Maybe lists under it.



=== optional
Assist me with quickly adding hyperlinks to my notes (if needed)- this might be something that leads to an article in our knowledgebase to help end user or future
tech who looks at the ticket on ServiceNow looking for solutions.
